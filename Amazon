Why Jenkins is used:
To automate software build and deployment processes.
To reduce integration issues and detect errors early.
To increase development productivity by freeing developers from manual tasks.
To enable continuous testing and continuous delivery.
To maintain a reliable and repeatable software delivery process.

Key Points about Jenkins:
Automation: Jenkins automates repetitive tasks such as building code, running tests, and deploying applications.
Continuous Integration: Developers can integrate code changes frequently, and Jenkins automatically builds and tests these changes to catch bugs early.
Plugins: Jenkins supports hundreds of plugins to integrate with tools like Git, Maven, Docker, Selenium, Kubernetes, and more.
Pipeline Support: Jenkins allows creating pipelines to define end-to-end workflows for CI/CD.
Notifications: Jenkins can notify teams about build status via email, Slack, or other channels.
